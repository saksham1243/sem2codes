algorithm for finding second largest number among n numbers using array
Main Function:
Start: Begin the program execution.
Input n: Prompt the user to enter the number of elements (n) they want to input.
Validate n: Check if the number of elements is greater than 1. If not, print an error message and exit.
Input numbers: Dynamically allocate an array of size n to store the numbers.
Input elements: Prompt the user to input n numbers and store them in the array.
Initialize variables: Initialize variables max, secondMax, maxPosition, and secondMaxPosition based on the first two elements of the array.
Find max and secondMax:
Iterate through the array starting from the third element.
Compare each element with max and secondMax to determine their positions.
Update max, secondMax, maxPosition, and secondMaxPosition accordingly.
Print result: Print the second largest number (secondMax) and its position in the array.
End: End the program execution.
Finding Max and SecondMax Function:
Start: Begin the function execution.
Input array: Receive the array of numbers and its size as parameters.
Initialize variables: Initialize variables max, secondMax, maxPosition, and secondMaxPosition based on the first two elements of the array.
Find max and secondMax:
Iterate through the array starting from the third element.
Compare each element with max and secondMax to determine their positions.
Update max, secondMax, maxPosition, and secondMaxPosition accordingly.
Return result: Return secondMax and secondMaxPosition as the result of the function.
End: End the function execution.
