algorithm for finding the smallest number among n numbers using arrays
Main Function:
Start: Begin the program execution.
Input n: Prompt the user to enter the number of elements (n) they want to input.
Validate n: Check if the number of elements is greater than 0. If not, print an error message and exit.
Input numbers: Dynamically allocate an array of size n to store the numbers.
Input elements: Prompt the user to input n numbers and store them in the array.
Initialize variables: Initialize variables min and minPosition based on the first element of the array.
Find min:
Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
Compare each element with min to determine the smallest number and its position.
Update min and minPosition accordingly.
Print result: Print the smallest number (min) and its position in the array.
End: End the program execution.
Finding Min Function:
Start: Begin the function execution.
Input array: Receive the array of numbers and its size as parameters.
Initialize variables: Initialize variables min and minPosition based on the first element of the array.
Find min:
Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
Compare each element with min to determine the smallest number and its position.
Update min and minPosition accordingly.
Return result: Return min and minPosition as the result of the function.
End: End the function execution.
